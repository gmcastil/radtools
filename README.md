Tools for processing experimental single event effects (SEE) data

Overview
========

Coming soon.

Features
========

Provides the following functionality:

* Produces cross sections vs. LET of indicated SEE type along with Poisson
  statistics.
* Allows user to enerate an initial Weibull fit to the cross section and allows
  real time manipulation of the function.
* Produces publication quality figures of cross sections.

Motivation
==========

As Eric S. Raymond once wrote, "Every good work of software starts by
scratching a developer's personal itch".  Most datasets that result from SEE
testing are in Microsoft Excel, since that tends to be the lowest common
denominator among engineers.  However, generating figures that are readable and
suitable for distribution in Excel tends to be a hassle.  The difficulty gets
compounded when there are upper bounds involved, Poisson statistics to be added
to each cross section, and Weibull curves to be added.  Even if you get the
data plotted that you want, it still looks awful and invariably, the image
gets put into a presentation of some sort and the results are grainy and
unreadable from the back of the room.

This was my personal itch and I figured there had to be a better way.
